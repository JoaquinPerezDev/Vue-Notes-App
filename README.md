# Vue-Notes-App

This app is created following the course work for The Vue 3 Bootcamp (https://www.udemy.com/course/the-vue-3-bootcamp-the-complete-developer-guide/) <br>

This is a note-taking app that lets the user create new notes, view created notes and delete notes as well. 
With this app I'll be learning:<br>
-conditional rendering with v-if <br>
-two-way binding with v-model <br>
-event handling to create new notes <br>
-iteratively rendering new elements with v-for <br>
-the importances of keys <br>
-error-handling <br>

You can check out the app yourself by forking the code and running "Npm run dev" in your terminal, then going to the indicated localhost address.
